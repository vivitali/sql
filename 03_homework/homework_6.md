**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

My previous projects were often related to healthcare or education fields with big amount of PII and financial information, so ensuring ethical practices in data handling was crucial. While we ensured data security through stringent access controls and logging mechanisms, these practices have been consistently reviewed and enhanced to maintain trust and compliance.

Also using data without explicit consent, even with good intentions, is unethical. Obviously user has to be informed about data collection and usage.  
So for example our application for payments. in order to support this requirment we implemented consent screen with information about data we collecting how our company uses them with option to opt-out for the customer.

From current perspective, I'd say that for a student application system project I'd introduce bias detection mechanism during data collection and processing. for example, algorithmic audits can help identify and mitigate biases in predictive models during students application.

Inequity in data practices can manifest through exclusionary designs and biased representations. For addressing this, cwe can use such techniques like:

- Inclusive Data Collection: data collection practices are inclusive and representative of all demographics is essential.
- Fair Representation: Design of data system should reflect diverse viewpoints and avoid reinforcing harmful stereotypes.
- Regular Impact Assessments: Conducting regular assessments to evaluate the social and economic impacts of data-driven decisions can help identify and address inequities. in case of Student application system.

To achieve this we have collected demographic information such as ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic status, disability status, and geographic location. This data can help identify and address disparities in access to educational opportunities, We also design application to be accessible for wide range of applicants including people with disabilities. Added different languages. Also now i this we have to continuos data analysis. This can involve looking at acceptance rates across different demographic groups, geographic areas, and socioeconomic statuses.
